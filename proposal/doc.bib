abstract="The retrieval performance of Cross-Language Retrieval (CLIR) systems is a function of the coverage of the translation lexicon used by them. Unfortunately, most translation lexicons do not provide a good coverage of proper nouns and common nouns which are often the most information-bearing terms in a query. As a consequence, many queries cannot be translated without a substantial loss of information and the retrieval performance of the CLIR system is less than satisfactory for those queries. However, proper nouns and common nouns very often appear in their transliterated forms in the target language document collection. In this work, we study two techniques that leverage this fact for addressing the problem, namely, Transliteration Mining and Transliteration Generation. The first technique attempts to mine the transliterations of out-of-vocabulary query terms from the document collection whereas the second generates the transliterations. We systematically study the effectiveness of both techniques in the context of the Hindi-English and Tamil-English ad hoc retrieval tasks at FIRE2010. The results of our study show that both techniques are effective in addressing the problem posed by out-of-vocabulary terms with Transliteration Mining technique giving better results than Transliteration Generation.",
